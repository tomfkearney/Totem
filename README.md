# Totem
Totem is a unity-based game built by a team of 4 between October and December 2013. Totem's Design is based on 3 immediately swappable characters with vastly different physics engine. They are:

- Gecko: Can run, jump, and cling onto grassy patches. 
- Bird: Can glide, covering long horizontal distances without falling too far. Swap from Gecko to Bird mid-jump to cruise with extra speed.
- Armadillo: Bouncy and armored. Has a boost to charge through enemies and break down walls. swap into armadillo from a bird flight to break through a wall suspended in the air.

Totem featured 15 levels of puzzles necessitating different combinations of each character's strengths. 3 original songs were composed for Totem's 3 characters plus 1 intro song, as well as a suite of original sound assets for SFX.
